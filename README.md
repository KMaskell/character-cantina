# Allica Bank Technical: Kat Maskell

## Overview

Thanks for taking the time to review my code - I really enjoyed working on this challenge!

## Tech Stack

- **React (Create React App)**
- **React Router**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tanstack Query**
- **Chakra UI**
- **Jest, React Testing Library (unit/ feature)**
- **Cypress (e2e)**
- **Vercel** for CI/CD

## Instructions for Running the Project Locally

1. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the app locally**  
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## **Cypress Test Coverage**  
To run the end-to-end tests with Cypress, follow these steps:

  * Open a terminal and run: `npm start` to launch the app:
  ```bash
   npm start
  ```

  * Open a second terminal and run: `npx cypress open`:
  ```bash
    npx cypress open
   ```
This will open Cypress' UI and you can run the e2e tests from there.


## If I had more time I would have...

- Gone nuts with the Star Wars theme & styling (Star Wars fonts, light/dark mode toggle, icons etc.)
- Integrated tests into the CI/CD pipeline for better automation.
- Moved hardcoded strings into i18n translation files for better localisation support.
- Tackled the bonus task and am happy to discuss a possible approach if I move forward to the next round.

## Challenges and Improvements

- **e2e Testing**: While I implemented key e2e tests, I would have liked to cover more user scenarios and edge cases. However, given the time constraints, I believe the tests I have written effectively showcase my ability to handle real-world testing needs.
- **Scalability & Performance**: Despite the time constraints, I’ve aimed to create a solution that is both scalable and performant. The structure and patterns used reflect my current skill set and my focus on delivering a robust, maintainable codebase.

## Conclusion

I hope this summary gives a clear understanding of my approach and the solution I’ve built. I’d be happy to go into more detail on any aspect of the project if needed.

Thank you for your time and consideration!

Kat
